# Waterfilling-Eigenbeamforming-MIMO
MATLAB code to show how Channel State Information (CSI) can effect system performance in terms of capacity.

This code evaluates the capacity of a MIMO channel in both a CSIR and a CSIT scenario. To validate the results of the code compare them with Figure3.4 and Figure3.5 of Hampton book, Introduction to MIMO communications.
If you have any questions about the code email me. I would be glad to help as much as I can.
