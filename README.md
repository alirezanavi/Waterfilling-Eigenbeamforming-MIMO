# Waterfilling-Eigenbeamforming-MIMO
MATLAB code to show how Channel State Information (CSI) can effect system performance in terms of capacity.
This code evaluates the capacity of a MIMO channel in both a CSIR and a CSIT scenario. To validate the results of the code compare them with Figure3.4 and Figure3.5 of Hampton book, Introduction to MIMO communications.
